# HiddenMsg
Hide data in PNG images by flipping the LSB values in each pixels RGB value.

# Explaination
Alice and Bob would like to talk in a secure manner (think PGP), while not attracting the attention of nosey Carol.
Not to attract any attention, they decide to hide their messages in the images they send eachother.

Use lossless PNGs/Webp images, you can modify the image colors slightly to hide binary data.
